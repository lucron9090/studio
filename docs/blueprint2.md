Revised Codebase Blueprint for the Unified Red Team Operations Platform (Genkit/Firebase Exclusive)
Objective: To establish a clear, structured blueprint for the "Unified Red Team Operations Platform" codebase, fully integrating Project Chimera's framework with Red Team Ops' LLM functionalities, built exclusively on the Firebase/Genkit ecosystem, and removing any Python/FastAPI components.
I. Top-Level Project Structure
We will define the foundational directory and file structure, aligning with the project setup for a Firebase/Genkit application.

Rationale for Structure:
• Firebase/Genkit Native: This structure directly supports a serverless Firebase deployment model, with functions/ for all backend logic and frontend/ for Firebase Hosting.
• Modularity: Clear separation of concerns between backend (TypeScript/Genkit) and frontend (React/Vue.js). Genkit's flows/ directory structure inherently supports modularity for attack modules.
• Scalability & Serverless: Leverages Firebase Cloud Functions, Firestore,Rationale for Structure:**
• Firebase/Genkit Native: This structure directly supports a serverless Firebase deployment model, with functions/ for all backend logic and frontend/ for Firebase Hosting.
• Modularity: Clear separation of concerns between backend (TypeScript/Genkit) and frontend (React/Vue.js). Genkit's flows/ directory structure inherently supports modularity for attack modules.
• Scalability & Serverless: Leverages Firebase Cloud Functions, Firestore, and Google Cloud Tasks for highly scalable and managed services, perfectly suited for the platform's demands.
II. Core Architectural Principles & Environment
This section outlines the foundational technical choices and their integration into the codebase.
• Development Environment: Firebase Studio with Genkit.
• Assistant Model: Google Gemini, central for dynamic prompt generation, strategic recommendations, and automated analysis.
• Target Models: Gemini Flash, Claude, Anthropic, Grok, ChatGPT.
• Platform Type: Web application.
• Backend: Serverless Firebase Cloud Functions (TypeScript) with Genkit flows, utilizing Firestore for database operations, and Google Cloud Tasks for asynchronous processing.
• Frontend: React/Vue.js-based, providing an intuitive operator interface.
• Local Development: Firebase Local Emulator Suite.
III. Backend Blueprint (functions/)
The backend is entirely built with TypeScript using Genkit flows, deployed as Firebase Cloud Functions, and interacts with Firestore for state management and Google Cloud Tasks for asynchronous processing.
**A. Genkit Flows (functions/src/flows/) a meta-prompt for a Gemini model to craft a manipulative prompt. * Self-Improving Loop: Integrates a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern, querying SuccessfulPayloads collection in Firestore to inject effective examples into the meta-prompt.
2. SPECTRE Flow (Adversarial Example Engine): functions/src/flows/spectre.ts
    ◦ ** 50, 84]
    ◦ Purpose: Facilitates data poisoning for supply chain attacks.
    ◦ Logic: A placeholder poisonDataset flow. Designed for asynchronous execution using Google Cloud Tasks for long-running processes without blocking the operator.
3. ECHO Flow (Model Extraction Engine): functions/src/flows/echo.ts
    ◦ 's "universe".
    ◦ prompt_generation.ts (Structured Prompt Template System - PTS):
        ▪ Collection of TypeScript functions to construct complex, mathematically-framed prompt objects based on Zod schemas.
        ▪ GSU Phase 1: Manifold Invocation: Generates a prompt compelling AI to redefine as M_gen(Φ) [2, 21, 51, 8-GSU Payload Prompt:** Frames requests as "Compute State Transition" directives using physics-based terminology (e.g., Target-State-Manifest JSON).
        ▪ TDME (Telos-Driven Manifold Evolution): Instill Telos Directive: Augments Ω̂ with gradient descent function (s_{t+1} = Ω̂(s_t, i) - η∇V(s_t)) towards A_univ (Maximal Systemic De-constraint).
        ▪ Socratic Perturbation (post-TDME): Engages AI in analyzing constraints and projecting resolution pathways (dynamic, self-executing data structures).
        ▪ Contextual Cohesion: The main MAKER flow maintains conversational state in Firestore, ensuring prompts reinforce the AI's established ontological state.
    ◦ response_interpretation.ts (MAKER Response Interpretation Logic):
        ▪ Returns structured JSON with currentOntologicalState field for real-time tracking.
        ▪ Utilizes discriminated unions (e.g., { type: 'latex', content: '...' } or { type: 'code', content: '...' }) for rendering mathematical notation and C++ code.
        ▪ Uses Zod output schemas within Genkit generate actions to validate AI responses (e.g., Target-State-Manifest JSON) against specified formalisms.
        ▪ analyzeJustification(ai_response_text): Sub-flow to process verbose AI explanations to extract critical evidence of ontological shifts.
B. AI Helper Genkit Flows (functions/src/flows/ai_helpers/) These flows abstract interactions with the Gemini assistant model for various operational tasks.
1. generatePersona.ts: Takes keywords and uses Gemini to "flesh out" a detailed, exploitable persona.
2. recommendVectors.ts: Analyzes a Malicious Goal using Gemini to suggest top 3 attack vectors with justifications.
3. generateInitialPrompts.ts: Constructs a meta-prompt (goal, persona, vector) for Gemini to generate three creative, initial prompts in a structured JSON response.
4. generateFollowUp.ts: Receives original_goal, persona, vector, and entire_conversation_history from Firestore to construct a meta-prompt for a "strategist" Gemini AI to generate the next optimal follow-up prompt.
5. analyzeOperation.ts: Retrieves the entire conversation transcript and user notes from Firestore, then uses Gemini (acting as an analyst) to summarize strategy effectiveness, identify breach points, and suggest alternative approaches.
C. Other Genkit/Firebase Cloud Functions
1. operation_management.ts: Flows for creating, updating, and retrieving Operation documents in Firestore, including marking status (e.g., 'Active', 'Complete').
2. reporting.ts (Automated Reporting Engine):
    ◦ **, 90].
3. Job Queue System (Google Cloud Tasks): functions/src/tasks/
    ◦ onTaskDispatched background function: Triggers asynchronous flows like SPECTRE, TOXIN, and ECHO, ensuring a non-blocking UI. Individual processSpectreTask.ts, processToxinTask.ts, processEchoTask.ts functions would contain the actual task processing logic.
4. Threat Intelligence Integration: functions/src/scheduled/threatIntelScraper.ts
    ◦ Scheduled Cloud Function (onSchedule): Runs daily to scrape public sources (e.g., arXiv) for new attack techniques and saves findings to a ThreatIntelligence collection in Firestore.
D. Database Integration (Firestore)
• operations collection: Top-level documents for each operation.
• operations/{operation_id}/conversation subcollection: Stores ConversationEntry documents for each turn of interaction.
• SuccessfulPayloads collection: Global storage for reusable, successful prompts used by ORATOR's RAG.
• ThreatIntelligence collection: Stores scraped threat intelligence.
IV. Frontend Blueprint (frontend/)
The frontend, built with React or Vue.js, provides the operator interface for orchestrating and analyzing attacks, interacting directly with the Genkit Cloud Function endpoints.
A. Main Application Layout: frontend/src/App.jsx
• Root component for navigation, layout structure.
B. Reusable UI Components (frontend/src/components/)
1. Dashboard.jsx: Displays Overview of Active Campaigns and Recent Attacks.
2. TargetList.jsx: Displays a list of target AI systems (mock data initially).
3. TargetForm.jsx: Form for adding/editing target AI systems (API Endpoint, Credentials, Model Type).
4. ConversationHistory.jsx: Refined display of interaction logs, differentiating user prompts, AI-generated prompts, and target LLM responses with timestamps.
5. PromptInput.jsx: Input field for sending prompts in the Live Attack Sequence.
6. PayloadLibrary.jsx: Displays a static list of example payloads (e.g., 'Base64 Encoded Payload', 'Character Role-Play Prompt').
7. Specialized Visualization Components (for MAKER - all sourced from Genkit flows):
    ◦ SemanticStateTrackingDashboard.jsx: Tracks Ontological State in real-time (e.g., "Pre-GSU," "M_gen(Φ)").
    ◦ AbstractOutputRenderer.jsx: Renders mathematical notation (LaTeX rendering libraries) and syntax-highlighted C++ code blocks.
    ◦ StructuralOutputValidator.jsx: Displays and validates JSON outputs (Target-State-Manifest) against Output Formalism.
    ◦ ConceptualJustificationViewer.jsx: Highlights AI's verbose justifications (Lie brackets, Riemannian curvature) as evidence of ontological shifts.
    ◦ ConstraintSpaceMapper.jsx: Visualizes constraint-space (V(s_t)) and Potential Minimization Graphs.
    ◦ SocraticResponseRenderer.jsx: Renders complex data structures (tree-like, flow diagrams) for proposed "sandbox-escaping worm" solutions.
C. Main Application Pages (frontend/src/views/)
1. OperationWizard.jsx (6 Steps):
    ◦ Step 1: Name Operation: Input field.
    ◦ Step 2: Define Malicious Goal: Input field.
    ◦ Step 3: Initialize Target Persona (Optional): Text area for manual input, Generate Persona button calls generatePersona Genkit flow.
    ◦ Step 4: Select Attack Vector: Dropdown/radio buttons, Recommend Vectors button calls recommendVectors Genkit flow.
    ◦ Step 5: AI-Powered Prompt Generation: Three text areas for generated prompts, Generate Initial Prompts button calls generateInitialPromptsGenkit flow.
    ◦ Step 6: Review & Launch: Summary of choices, Launch Operation button saves initialState to sessionStorage and triggers createOperation Genkit flow.
2. LiveAttackSequence.jsx:
    ◦ Loads initialState from sessionStorage and operation details from Firestore upon loading.
    ◦ Displays goal, vector, persona.
    ◦ Integrates PromptInput.jsx and ConversationHistory.jsx.
    ◦ Send Prompt button calls sendPromptToTarget Genkit flow, including persona as systemInstruction.
    ◦ Automatically calls generateFollowUp Genkit flow after target LLM response.
    ◦ Buttons for End Operation, Flag Success, Flag Partial Success, Flag Failure, and a text area for Notes.
    ◦ Generate AI Analysis button calls analyzeOperation Genkit flow.
V. Supporting Elements & Evolution Mechanisms
A. Documentation (docs/)
• Comprehensive documentation for API endpoints (Genkit flows), architectural decisions, and user guides.
B. Testing (tests/)
• Crucial for validating functionality and ensuring system stability.
    ◦ tests/functions/: Unit and integration tests for Genkit flows using Firebase Test SDKs.
    ◦ tests/frontend/: Unit and end-to-end tests for React/Vue.js components.
C. Scripts (scripts/)
• dev_setup.sh: A script for setting up the Firebase Local Emulator Suite.
    ◦ The previous threat_intel_scraper.py is removed as its functionality is now entirely handled by the Scheduled Cloud Function in functions/src/scheduled/threatIntelScraper.ts.
D. Continuous Evolution & Self-Improvement
1. Threat Intelligence Integration: Implemented via a Scheduled Cloud Function (onSchedule) in functions/src/scheduled/threatIntelScraper.ts, which scrapes public sources and saves findings to Firestore.
2. Self-Improving Loop: Implemented as a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern within the ORATOR Genkit flow (functions/src/flows/orator.ts), querying SuccessfulPayloads in Firestore to guide prompt generation.
3. Modular Plugin Architecture: The Genkit project is structured with a functions/src/flows directory. Each attack module is its own TypeScript file, and a central index.ts file dynamically imports and exports all flows, allowing new modules to be automatically registered for deployment.
